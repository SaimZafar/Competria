> **Competria:** A Competitive Programming Platform
Competria is a comprehensive platform designed to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for competitive programming enthusiasts. Whether you are a problem solver or an administrator managing challenges, Competria offers a robust toolset inspired by leading platforms like Codeforces. With features like a built-in code editor, compiler integration, dynamic database synchronization, and user-friendly workflows, Competria aims to simplify the competitive programming journey for all its users.

The platform offers a range of user-centric features. Users can solve coding challenges using an integrated editor powered by QScintilla, which supports syntax highlighting and code assistance. With GCC/G++ compilers seamlessly integrated, solutions can be compiled and executed instantly, providing real-time feedback on test cases. Additionally, Competria includes a leaderboard system that ranks users based on their performance, promoting healthy competition. For administrators, the platform simplifies problem and test case management, offering tools to create, edit, and validate problems effortlessly.

Competria also features a modern and visually appealing user interface, designed using Figma to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience. The secure authentication system supports role-based access, ensuring smooth operation for both users and administrators. A lightweight SQLite database is used for efficient data handling, with provisions to transition to a scalable MySQL system in the future.

To install Competria, clone the repository, set up dependencies like the Qt Framework and GCC/G++, and configure the database. The application can be built and run using Qt Creator, and the database can be initialized with the provided SQLite file. For MySQL users, database settings can be updated in the source code.

While developing Competria, several challenges were encountered. These included integrating QScintilla with GCC/G++ compilers, managing real-time synchronization between the database and the UI, and implementing robust logic for test case validation. Addressing these challenges required thoughtful design and a focus on performance and reliability.

Future enhancements for Competria include adding support for multiple programming languages, improving the leaderboard functionality, enabling problem tagging and filtering by topics or difficulty, and transitioning to a relational database system like MySQL for better scalability. Additional features such as forums and solution explanations are also planned to foster community engagement and collaboration.
